# Medical Insurance Project

This repository contains code and analyses related to a medical insurance project, part of Codecademy's Python Fundamentals for Data Science course. The project involves analyzing and manipulating medical insurance cost data using Python.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into several scripts and notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the analysis. Here's a brief overview of the files included:

### 1. `py-dict-medical-insurance-project.py`
This script demonstrates how to manage medical insurance data using dictionaries. Key functionalities include:
- Adding and updating records.
- Calculating total and average insurance costs.
- Creating a medical database.
- Implementing functions to update records and calculate insurance costs.

### 2. `python_functions_medical_insurance.py`
This script contains functions for calculating insurance costs and comparing them:
- `calculate_insurance_cost()`: Estimates insurance costs based on various parameters.
- `calculate_cost_difference()`: Computes the difference between two insurance costs.

### 3. `python-strings-insurance-project.py`
This script focuses on data cleaning and processing:
- Replaces delimiters in the data.
- Counts and cleans records.
- Analyzes data such as names, ages, BMIs, and insurance costs.
- Calculates average BMI in the dataset.

### 4. `Python Loops Medical Insurance Estimates vs Costs.ipynb`
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use loops and conditions to analyze insurance cost data:
- Calculates average insurance costs.
- Compares individual insurance costs to the average.
- Uses list comprehensions to adjust estimated costs.
